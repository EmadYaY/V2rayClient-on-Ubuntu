first, on all, we need to download the v2ray core: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.6.2 
secondly, we need to install qv2ray to have a UI to see and easily control: https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/releases
then we should unzip the core file and make qv2ray executable like an App
for run qv2ray if that wasn't working we should install the libfuse by this command Sudo apt install libfuse2
